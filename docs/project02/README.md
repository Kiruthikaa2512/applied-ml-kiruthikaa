# Project 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Author**: Kiruthikaa Natarajan Srinivasan  
**Date**: October 29, 2025  

## Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore factors that influenced passenger survival. We perform data inspection, visualization, cleaning, feature engineering, and train/test splitting to prepare the dataset for modeling. The goal is to identify meaningful predictors and ensure balanced evaluation using stratified sampling.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is loaded directly from the seaborn library for consistency. It includes both numeric and categorical features such as age, fare, class, gender, and survival status.

## Structure

The notebook follows a structured format with clearly numbered sections:
1. Import and Inspect the Data  
2. Data Exploration and Preparation  
3. Feature Selection and Justification  
4. Splitting the Data for Training and Testing  

Each section includes reflection questions to demonstrate understanding and reasoning.

## Requirements

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Notes

This project is for educational purposes and follows the structure of Lab 2. All analysis is original and aligned with academic integrity guidelines.
